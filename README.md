# Pharyngitis-Diagnostic-Convolutional-Neural-Network-MATLAB-

Project based in MATLAB very simple dataset (100 control/49 experiment)

uses "adam", but of course "sgdm" can be used in lines interchangeably. (ADAM showed better accuracy in preliminary)

I have preprocessed all 149 images at 100x100 px resolution.

Feel free to add on or make it more complex.
